# polytrope

This script can numerically evaluate, in parallel, eigenmodes at $(k_x, k_y)$ for the linear waves in a polytropic atmosphere where the magnetic field is perpendicular to the vertical-gravity and varies as $\mathbf{B_0}(z) \sim z^{(n+1)/2} \hat{\mathbf{e}_{y}}$ ; gas pressure and magnetic pressure both vary as $\sim z^{n+1}$, and density varies as $\sim z^n$ where n is the polytropic index.
